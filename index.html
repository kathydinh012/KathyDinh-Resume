        <div class="subheading mb-5">Cardiothoracic Surgeon üè•</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Kathy Dinh and here is some background information of me prior to being a cardiothoracic surgeon. During my high school and college period, I became a volunteer EMT with 150+ hours at the local Fire Department located in Anaheim near my house. I got to experience and learn how to receive emergency alarms and calls, operate various communication equipment in the department and in ambulances. I was able to grasp and apply emergency medical services and disaster control with the information I obtained during my time as a volunteer EMT.  Additionally, I was also a volunteer in the messenger unit for St. Joseph's Hospital starting my junior year of high school until the summer going into my first year of college. As part of the messenger unit, I learned how to escort and discharge patients based on a protocol; I also learned how to take incoming unit calls and record the necessary information regarding the caller's name, unit name, patient's name, and room number into the system. Through my experience as a volunteer in St. Joseph's Hospital, I came to naturally learn the various color codes of hospitals, how to navigate hospital settings, and a general overview of what each department does. On top of that, I also have 100+ hours of medical scribe volunteer work at the Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC). As a medical scribe volunteer, I shadowed a physician the entirety of my experience helping her with organizing, transcribing, and receiving results/data for patient's laboratory tests, medication, and imaging studies. Not only that, but I was able to assist my physician during patient consultations and recorded patient(s) history along with physical exam findings into the system. During my experience as a medical scribe, I was able to learn a multitude of things varying from understanding how to medically organize and input things into the system to slowly gaining knowledge of many medical terms that was beneficial to me in the future. For my education, I attended Oxford Academy from 7th to 12th grade located in Cypress, with rankings of 1st in the District and 12th in the nation. Afterwards, I continued my education at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) where I graduated with a Bachelors in the degree of Biology. To pursue my dream of becoming a surgeon, I attended UCSF School of Medicine for 4 years where I received my medical degree (M.D).  <br><br>

        I am now a cardiothoracic surgeon.     <br><br>

        Since I have finished my residency period lasting 5 years, I am currently actively searching for a position to fill at a hospital.
